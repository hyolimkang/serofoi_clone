\description{
This method extracts a summary corresponding to a serological model object that contains information about the original serological 
survey data used to fit the model, such as the year when the survey took place, the type of test taken and the corresponding antibody, 
as well as information about the convergence of the model, like the expected log pointwise predictive density \code{elpd} and its 
corresponding standar deviation.
