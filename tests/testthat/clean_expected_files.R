# This script removes the svg and csv files used in the automatic tests
# This is usually required when a new version of rstan is released
# Random number generation changes for each new version of
# Rstan, https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_18/reference-manual/reproducibility-chapter.html
# thus all files with expected results (both tables and graphs) become
# obsolete and need to be regenerated
